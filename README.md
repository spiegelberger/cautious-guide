# spring-mvc-reddit-clone

In this repository I tried to reproduce Dan Vega's Redit clone (https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-2/learn/lecture/12833500?start=0#overview)
with more or less success. 


Besides the obvious differences due to the version differences, I tried to solve some problems and shortcomings of the original program.
I have also tried to use Lombok more consistently than Dan Vega, but this led to a validation problem that I have not yet solved.


An amazingly thorough documentation of the original project can be found here: https://www.danvega.dev/docs/spring-boot-2-docs/
